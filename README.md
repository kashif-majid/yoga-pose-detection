# yoga-pose-detection
• In this project we construct a web-based yoga pose detection application.
• Using the Move-Net algorithm, we attempt to recognise yoga postures in our Proposed System.
• The model considers both the posture confidence score and the key points. There are 17 key points in each posture, each of which has an absolute x, y coordinate, confidence level, and name.
• When a user fails to hold a specified Yoga position, the countdown stops gives the best time of user and restarts when the user returns to the right pose.
